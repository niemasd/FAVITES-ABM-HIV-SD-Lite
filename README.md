# FAVITES-ABM-HIV-SD-Lite
A simplified simulation pipeline specifically for ABM-HIV SD

Assumes that [`abm_hiv-HRSA_SD`](https://github.com/mathematica-pub/abm_hiv/tree/HRSA_SD) is in `/usr/local/bin`, so the [`abm_hiv_commandline.R`](https://github.com/mathematica-pub/abm_hiv/blob/HRSA_SD/abm_hiv_commandline.R) script is located at `/usr/local/bin/abm_hiv-HRSA_SD/abm_hiv_commandline.R` and the [`modules`](https://github.com/mathematica-pub/abm_hiv/tree/HRSA_SD/modules) folder is located at `/usr/local/bin/abm_hiv-HRSA_SD/modules` (but the user can override via command-line arguments).
